Statistics about the articles get created from that data and made accessable thorugh a restful api. There is also a frontend that visualises the data.

#What technologies are used?
ASP.net in C# for the aggregation and processing of the data and for the restful api.
HTML, CSS, JQuery and Bootstrap for the frontend.
